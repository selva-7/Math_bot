# Math_bot
Task given by BUSINESSONBOT

Here's an explanation of how this code works:

1.The math_bot() function is defined to handle user input and perform mathematical operations.
2.The bot starts by greeting the user and asking for input.
3.The while loop continues to run until the user chooses to exit.
4.The bot asks the user to input a mathematical operation and checks if it's valid.
5.If the operation is valid, the bot asks for the two operands and performs the corresponding operation using the dictionary of operators.
6.If the user tries to divide by zero, the bot displays an error message and returns to the top of the loop.

After each operation, the bot asks if the user wants to perform another operation. If the user enters anything other than "yes", the bot exits the loop and says goodbye.
